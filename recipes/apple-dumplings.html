            <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>Apple Dumplings are super easy to make and taste great. While you could go through the process of making a whole apple pie, this quick and easy dessert tastes just as good with a scoop of ice cream. Similar to apple pie, you will want to use granny smith apples or other baking apples for the best results. For our dough we will use ready-made crescent dough so that assembly will be easy and we won't have nearly the mess to clean up.</p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 granny smith apples</li>
                    <li>2 cans crescent dough</li>
                    <li>3/4 c. (1 1/2 sticks) butter</li>
                    <li>1 c. brown sugar</li>
                    <li>1 1/2 tsp. cinnamon</li>

                </ul>
